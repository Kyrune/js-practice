// Given a list of integers, calculate their differences and find the difference with the smallest absolute value.

// The absolute difference is the positive difference between two values a and b, is written |a - b| or |b - a| and they are equal. If a = 3 and b = 2, |3 - 2| = |2 - 3| = 1. 
// Given an array of integers, find the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in the array.

// minimumAbsoluteDifference has the following parameter(s):
// arr[n]: an array of integers.

// Returns
// The minimum absolute difference found.

function minimumAbsoluteDifference(arr) {
