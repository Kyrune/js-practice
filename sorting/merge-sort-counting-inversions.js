// Write a Comparator for sorting elements in an array.

// Comparators are used to compare two objects. In this challenge, you'll create a comparator and use it to sort an array. 
// The Player class is provided in the editor below. It has two fields:

// 1. name: a string
// 2. score: an integer

// Given an array of n Player objects, write a comparator that sorts them in order of decreasing score. If 2 or more players have
// the same score, sort those players alphabetically ascending by name.
