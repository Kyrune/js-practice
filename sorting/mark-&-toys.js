// You are Mark's best friend and have to help him buy as many toys as possible.

// Mark and Jane are very happy after having their first child. Their son loves toys, so Mark wants to buy some. 
// There are a number of different toys lying in front of him, tagged with their prices. Mark has only a certain amount to spend, 
// and he wants to maximize the number of toys he buys with this money. Given a list of toy prices and an amount to spend, 
// determine the maximum number of gifts he can buy.

// Note Each toy can be purchased only once.
