// An hourglass in A is a subset of values with indices falling in this pattern in arr's graphical representation:
// a b c
//   d
// e f g
// There are 16 hourglasses in arr. An hourglass sum is the sum of an hourglass' values. 
// Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in arr, then print the maximum hourglass sum. The array will always be 6 x 6.
