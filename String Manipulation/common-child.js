// Given two strings a and b of equal length, what's the longest string(s) that can be constructed such that s is a child to both a and b?

// A string is said to be a child of a another string if it can be formed by deleting 0 or more characters from the other string. 
// Letters cannot be rearranged. Given two strings of equal length, what's the longest string that can be constructed such that it is a child of both?

// commonChild has the following parameter(s):

// string s1: a string
// string s2: another string
// Returns the length of the longest string which is a common child of the input strings

function commonChild(s1, s2) {
